'''
In this algorithm, we start by creating the initial node, which is a tuple of the form (fitness, lower_bound, upper_bound).
The fitness is the value of the function for the lower_bound, and the lower_bound and upper_bound are binary vectors of dimension d.
The initial node's upper and lower bounds are both initialized to all zeros and all ones respectively.
The algorithm then repeatedly selects the node with the best lower bound from the priority queue and checks if it can be branched.
If it can be branched, it creates two child nodes (left and right) by setting the upper and lower bounds of the child node to the upper and lower bounds of the parent node.
The algorithm stops when the priority queue is empty. The best_solution and best_fitness are returned as the solution of the problem.
This is a basic implementation of Branch and Bound algorithm and can be improved with more advanced techniques such as dynamic programming and cutting plane method.
It's important to note that the results of this algorithm may vary depending on the specific function you're trying to minimize.

'''
In this example, the Branch and Bound algorithm is implemented by creating a tree of possible solutions, where each node represents a possible solution. The algorithm starts with a random initial solution and checks if it satisfies the constraint, if not it adds the penalty function to the fitness. The tree is traversed using a priority queue, where the node with the best fitness is always at the top. The algorithm repeatedly selects the best node and splits it into two new nodes, until the queue is empty or a solution with the desired constraint is found.

It's important to note that the specific implementation of the tree structure, the priority queue and the splitting of the nodes will depend on the problem you are trying to solve. Also, the results of this algorithm may vary depending on the specific function you're trying to minimize and the specific parameter values you choose.
