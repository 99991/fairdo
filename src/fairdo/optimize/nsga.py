    Perform NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) for multi-objective optimization.

    NSGA-II maintains a population of solutions and uses non-dominated sorting and crowding distance to select
    the best solutions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fitness_functions : list of callables
        The list of fitness functions to optimize. Each function should take a binary vector and return a scalar value.
    d : int
        The number of dimensions.
    pop_size : int
        The size of the population.
    num_generations : int
        The number of generations.
    initialization : callable, optional
        The function to initialize the population. Default is random_initialization.
    selection : callable, optional
        The function to perform selection. Default is tournament_selection.
    crossover : callable, optional
        The function to perform crossover. Default is simulated_binary_crossover.
    mutation : callable, optional
        The function to perform mutation. Default is polynomial_mutation.
    maximize : bool, optional
        Whether to maximize or minimize the fitness functions. Default is False.
    tol : float, optional
        The tolerance for early stopping. Default is 1e-6.
    patience : int, optional
        The number of generations to wait before early stopping. Default is 50.

    Returns
    -------
    best_population : ndarray, shape (d,)
        The best solution found by NSGA-II.
    best_fitness : ndarray, shape (num_fitness_functions,)
        The fitness values of the best solution found by NSGA-II.

    Notes
    -----
    The fitness functions must map the binary vector to a scalar value, i.e., :math:`f: \{0, 1\}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`.
